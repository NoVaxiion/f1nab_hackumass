# 🏎️ F1NAB — Formula 1 AI Chat & Data Exploration

**F1NAB** (Formula 1 News & Analysis Bot) is a hybrid AI assistant and data analytics project originally developed during **HackUMass**.  
It began as a **Python-based scraper and vector search tool**, later rebuilt as a **React + Node.js AI chat interface** styled after the Formula 1 brand.

---

## ⚙️ Repository Purpose

This repo is a **fork of the main F1NAB project**, created to:
- Complete **final UI repairs and functional updates**
- Preserve the **original Python backend modules**
- Showcase the **final AI chat interface** and Formula 1 theming  

> ⚠️ The **Pinecone vector database** is **hosted online and private**, so cloning this repo will **not reproduce full functionality**.  
This version is for **reference, archival, and educational** purposes only.

---

## ⚠️ Project Status

In **December 2024**, the official **Formula 1** website implemented stricter scraping and API blocks, breaking data collection and embeddings.  
Since then:
- Scraper and embedding generation were **deprecated**
- Pinecone index remains **private / read-only**
- Project is **archived** and **no longer maintained**

---

## 💡 Overview

F1NAB explored how **AI**, **automation**, and **semantic data search** can be combined for real-time Formula 1 insights.

### Development Timeline
**Phase 1 – HackUMass (Python)**
- Scraped Formula 1 race data via BeautifulSoup  
- Created vector embeddings with Pinecone  
- Queried and stored structured data in SQLite  

**Phase 2 – React + OpenAI UI**
- Rebuilt into an interactive F1-themed chat interface  
- Integrated Node.js / Express + OpenAI API  
- Added animated greetings, dynamic chat bubbles, and race backgrounds
